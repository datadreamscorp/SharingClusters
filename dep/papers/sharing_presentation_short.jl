"Conflicts are reduced to a minimum within a lineage or co-resident group of agnates who stand, after all, as a virtual lineage (...) **The phrase iba dibi sai (my real people) is an expression of this solidarity, as is the sharing of food and services, and the proximity of their dwellings and garden plots**. The closeness and cooperation between co-resident agnates, made evident with a simple glance at a village's 'economic map,' are even more apparent when compared with the situation of people who have no agnates nearby. Agnatically isolated men may not be economically deprived, but they lack the comfort and security of counting on their relatives for whatever needs arise. Men who have no close agnates or live apart from them are more prone to accusations of theft, adultery, and other abusive acts. The phrase iba ai dibi (my others) denotes the ambivalence that exists in the relationship between affines and distant kin. They are both 'my people' (iba dibi) and 'other people'. The discomfort that accompanies much of their interactions can be observed in certain situations." (Ramos, 1995, p. 90)

"As villages grow larger, internal order and cooperation become more difficult, and eventually factions develop: Certain kin take sides with each other, and social life becomes strained. **There appears to be an upper limit to the size of a group that can be cooperatively organized by the principles of kinship, descent, and marriage (...) kinship-organized groups can only get so large before they begin falling apart—fissioning into smaller groups**." (Chagnon, 2012, p. 78)

"One side of the Melanesian contradiction is the initial economic reciprocity
between  a  center-man  and  his  followers. For  his  help  they  give  their  help,
and  for  goods  going  out  through  his  hands  other  goods  (often  from  outside
factions)  flow  back  to his followers  by  the  same  path. The  other  side  is that a  cumulative  build-up  of  renown  forces  center-men  into  economic  extortion of  the  faction. Here  it  is  important  that  not  merely  his  own  status,  but  the standing  and  perhaps  the  military  security  of  his  people  depend  on  the  big-man's  achievements  in public  distribution. **Established  at the head  of  a sizeable  faction,  a  center-man  comes  under  increasing  pressure  to  extract  goods from  his followers, to delay reciprocities owing them,  and to  deflect  incoming goods  back  into  external  circulation. Success  in  competition  with  other  big-men  particularly  undermines  internal-factional  reciprocities:  such  success  is precisely  measurable  by the  ability  to  give outsiders  more   than  they  can possibly  reciprocate**. In  well  delineated  big-man  polities,  we  find  leaders  negating  the  reciprocal  obligations  upon  which  their  following  had  been  predicated.  Substituting extraction for  reciprocity, they must compel their people to  "eat  the  leader's  renown,"  as  one  Solomon  Island  group  puts  it,  in  return for  productive  efforts. Some  center-men  appear  more  able  than  others  to dam  the  **inevitable  tide  of  discontent  that  mounts  within  their  factions**,  perhaps  because  of  charismatic  personalities,  perhaps  because  of  the  particular social  organizations  in  which  they  operate. But  paradoxically  **the  ultimate defense  of the center-man's  position  is some slackening  of his drive to enlarge the  funds  of  power**. The  alternative  is  much  worse. In  the  anthropological record  there  are  not  merely  instances  of  big-man  chicanery  and  of  material deprivation  of  the  faction  in  the  interests  of  renown,  but  some  also  of  overloading  of social  relations  with  followers:  the  generation  of antagonisms, defections,  and  in  extreme  cases  the  violent  liquidation  of  the  center-man."

"The  growth  of  a  political  system  such  as  the  Polynesian  constitutes
advance  over  Melanesian  orders  of  interpersonal  dominance  in  the  human
control  of  human  affairs. Especially significant for society  at  large  were
privileges  accorded  Polynesian  chiefs  which  made  them  greater  architects of funds  of  power  than  ever was  any  Melanesian  big-man. Masters  of their people and "owners" in a titular  sense of  group resources, **Polynesian  chiefs  had  rights  of  call  upon  the  labor  and  agricultural  produce of  households  within  their  domains**. Economic  mobilization  did  not  depend on,  as  it  necessarily  had  for  Melanesian  big-men,  the  de  novo creation  by the  leader  of  personal  loyalties  and  economic  obligations. A  chief  need  not stoop to  obligate  this  man  or  that  man,  need  not  by  a  series  of  individual  acts of generosity induce others  to support  him,  for economic  leverage  over a group  was  the  inherent  chiefly  due."

He continues:

"Redistribution  of  the fund  of power was the supreme art of Polynesian  politics. By  well-planned  *noblesse  oblige*  the  large  domain  of  a  paramount  chief  was held  together,  organized  at  times  for  massive  projects,  protected  against  other chiefdoms,  even  further enriched. Uses  of  the  chiefly  fund included  lavish hospitality and entertainments for outside chiefs and for the chief's own people,  **and succor  of  individuals  or  the  underlying  population at  large  in times  of  scarcities  —  bread  and  circuses**." (Sahlins, 1963. Emphasis is mine.)
